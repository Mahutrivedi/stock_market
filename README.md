In this project I have predicted next day closing price of a stock using previous 6 days data such as open/high/low/close/volume.

The stock used in this project is deepak nitrite (NSE). Previous 5 year data is used to train the model.  

The data is downloaded from yahoo finance and the data only containes open/high/low/close/volume data.

The remaining columns are created using these pre-availble columns. 

Artificially created columns include previous 6 day open/high/low/close, %change in price of previous 6 days and some technical tools such as relative strength index, moving average etc.
